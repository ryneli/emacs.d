- Trapped error :: the execution errors that cause the computation to stop immediately
| Trapped error              | Untrapped error              |
|----------------------------+------------------------------|
| Divide-by-zero             | Buffer overflow in C         |
| array out of bound in Java | Jumping to the wrong address |
- Forbidden errors :: all the untrapped errors, and part of the trapped errors
- Type safety :: The property stating that programs do not cause untrapped errors
- Type soundness :: The property stating that programs do not cause forbidden errors
- Explicitly typed language :: types are part of the syntax
- Strong typed language :: guarantee all programs are well-behaved
